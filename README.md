# A proof-of-concept cabal solver example using SAT

1. Install the `minisat` binary to your `PATH`.
[http://www.minisat.se/MiniSat.html](http://minisat.se/MiniSat.html).

2. Edit the `deps` function in `Cabal.hs` so that the location of the
cabal index tarball is the one on your system.

3. Run `saveOpaleyeDeps` to load the cabal index tarball, parse all
the cabal files within, and save the dependencies that pertain to the
`opaleye` package.  This step is very slow (around 100 seconds on my
machine) because I parse all cabal files at the start, rather than
parsing them on demand.  A fairly basic fix could speed up this stage
a lot.

4. Run `main` to find the install plan for opaleye which requires the
fewest dependent packages to be installed.  This takes around 15
seconds on my machine.  Speeding this up is work in progress.

```
ghci Main.hs
*Main> saveOpaleyeDeps
...
*Main> main
Looking for 0 <= num packages < 100
Looking for 0 <= num packages < 49
...
```

Please note that that the modules besides `Cabal`, `Main` and `Solve`
are rather mysterious and should probably be ignored.
